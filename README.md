# maintenance-optimisation
IBM ILOG CPLEX-driven optimisation of a maintenance schedule for a simulated component with stochastic lifetime in a Markov Decision Process.

An age-replacement policy (ARP), a block-replacement policy (BRP), and a modified block-replacement policy (MBRP) are all explored.

From my bachelor paper, replicating some of the results of [Schouten et al. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221721007633) before extending in various directions.
